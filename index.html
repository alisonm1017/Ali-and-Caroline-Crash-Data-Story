          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead">In October of 2021, the city of Hartford installed traffic-calming speed humps on Flatbush Avenue in an attempt to reduce the number of crashes that were frequently occurring on the street. This research was conducted to see the effectiveness of the speed humps and whether or  not more should be installed on other busy streets in Hartford. These traffic-calming humps were also installed on other major streets surrounding Trinity College, including Summit Street, Allen Place, and Wethersfield Avenue. We’ve chosen to analyze the speed humps on Flatbush Avenue due to the fact that they were installed the earliest, and therefore have the most data available. The city of Hartford hoped that by introducing these speed humps, drivers would slow down and drive more cautiously. With Trinity being located in such a busy area, the safety and well-being of the students was also another push for installation of the humps, especially after the tragic death of a fellow student in March of 2022. Last March, a young girl and her two friends were struck by a fast-moving car on New Britain Avenue. Following the crash, the city also installed white bollards on New Britain Ave in an attempt to reduce the high number of crashes that had been occuring. Currently, there is data prior to the installation and for up to 17 months post installation, and the results are extremely helpful to the city of Hartford. Because the city of Hartford wants what is best for its people, it is important to ask the question, did crashes change after traffic-calming speed humps were installed on Flatbush Ave? We will be analyzing this data from two different date ranges: 12 months pre and post speed hump installation(shown in Figure 1), and 17 months pre and post speed hump installation in order to examine the immediate and long-term effects of these traffic-calming measures. </p>

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future DataViz students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, such as <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/'>CT EdSight</a>, and also link to your shared Google Sheets.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>
