          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>In October of 2021, the city of Hartford installed speed humps on Flatbush Avenue, a corridor located a street over from Trinity College, in an attempt to reduce the number of crashes that were frequently occurring on the street (see Figure 1). Speed humps are large and wide raised surfaces in roadways. They are cost-effective, traffic-calming measures that aim to slow down drivers, reduce the speed they are going, and consequently, reduce the number of crashes from high speed collisions. Local governments, like the city of Hartford, intentionally installed these humps in hopes that drivers would be more cautious when driving and make the city's streets more safe. This research was conducted to see the effectiveness of the speed humps and whether or not more should be installed on other busy streets in Hartford. These traffic-calming humps were also installed on other major streets surrounding Trinity College, including Summit Street, Allen Place, and Wethersfield Avenue. 
 </p>
          <p>We’ve chosen to analyze the speed humps on Flatbush Avenue due to the fact that they were installed the earliest, and therefore have the most data available. With Trinity being located in such a busy area, the safety and well-being of the students was also another push for installation of the humps, especially after the tragic death of a fellow student in March of 2022. Last March, a young girl and her two friends were struck by a fast-moving car on New Britain Avenue. Following the crash, the city also installed white bollards on New Britain Ave in an attempt to reduce the high number of crashes that had been occuring.</p>
          
          <p>Currently, there is data prior to the installation and for up to 17 months post installation, and the results are extremely helpful to the city of Hartford. Because the city of Hartford wants what is best for its people, it is important to ask the question, did crashes change after traffic-calming speed humps were installed on Flatbush Ave? We will be analyzing this data from two different date ranges: 12 months pre and post speed hump installation, and 17 months pre and post speed hump installation in order to examine the immediate and long-term effects of these traffic-calming measures.</p>

          <h2>Findings & Evidence</h2>
          <p>Before delving into our findings, it is important to note that the effectiveness of speed humps on Flatbush Avenue depends largely on the time period that you choose to examine in this early stage. Our analysis focuses on 12 months pre and post installation as well as 17 months pre and post installation, and depending on which of these analyses you look at, the results tell different stories. As you will see below, the analysis of the 12 months pre and post installation shows an increase in crashes, while on the other hand, the analysis of the 17 months pre and post installation shows an overall decrease in crashes. As you look at and analyze our findings in the following paragraphs and visuals, it is important to keep this in mind. Furthermore, we will touch more on some possible reasons as to why this is later in this data story.</p>
         
          
          <h2><b>12 Month Analysis</b></h2>
        
          
           <iframe title="Crash Counts Increase on Flatbush Avenue After Speed Hump Installation" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-42OM8" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/42OM8/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
   
        <p>Based on the visualization above, we can see that in the 12 months post installation of speed humps on Flatbush Avenue, crashes increased. In the 12 months before installation, there were 50 crashes while in the 12 months that followed there were 59 crashes. This increase was a percent change of 18% which is rather steep considering the speed humps are meant to be speed calming measures. One possible cause of this increase in crashes may be the fact that speed humps were new in this area and drivers were not used to them or not aware that they were there. This could’ve caused more crashes unexpectedly which would explain why there were more crashes in the year following the installation of the speed humps.</p>

        <p>Figure 2: Crashes on Flatbush 17 Months Pre vs Post Speed Hump Installation <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/n4x6N/'>(interactive chart)</a>

        <p>Based on the visualization above, we can see that 17 months after the installation of traffic-calming speed humps, the number of crashes occurring on Flatbush Avenue had decreased. Starting in June of 2020, 17 months prior to the installation of the humps, and up until October of 2021, the month the humps were installed, there were 87 crashes. 17 months after installation, the number of crashes went from 87 to 72. This decrease in crashes was a percent change of -17%, which is a really great statistic for the city of Hartford. These numbers and data show that the speed humps have been successful in slowing drivers so that less crashes are occuring. As a result of this, the city of Hartford is encouraged to install more traffic-calming speed humps around the campus of Trinity College and the rest of the city.</p>

          <h2>Interpreting the Findings</h2>
          
          <p>After analyzing these results, the question that arises is, why did the number of crashes increase after the speed humps were installed for 12 months? It may have been thought that the humps would immediately start to slow drivers and reduce the amount of crashes occurring; however, there are many different factors that could contribute to this reasoning. The first to consider is the fact that perhaps there were fewer drivers on the road, leading to fewer crashes recorded, during the early stages of the pandemic. Because the humps were installed in October of 2021, the 12 months prior to installation would put the time frame of data around October 2020, which was still during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This being said, COVID forced a lot of people and drivers to stay inside, work from home, and stay off the roads. A general decrease in drivers on the road would explain the relatively lower number of crashes on Flatbush, seeing as fewer drivers means a lower probability of crashes occurring. Secondly, we draw attention to the fact that speed humps were a relatively new traffic-calming measure being used in the city of Hartford and in this particular area. The ‘new’ factor could have thrown off drivers and caused a slight increase in crashes in the 12 months post installation, therefore accounting for a small spike in crashes in the 12 months post installation. This type of ‘acclamation period’ to new traffic features is common and previously noted by other Hartford city planners and officials. Overall, while our 12 month analysis and 17 month analysis offer contradictory findings, there are some underlying causes that explain these discrepancies.</p>

          <h2>Sources & Methods</h2>

          <p>Before delving into our process for going about this crash data, we should draw your attention to the fact that our chosen installation date of October 2021 is our best estimate and not a definite fact. Based on crash data from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O-Hky14yzEMBFVRaSo6uCIlyl87Qgdio6BmxDmI84A/edit#gid=423112405">2018-2022</a> we determined that crashes on Flatbush with speed humps present began in October of 2021. We are unable to get a specific date however, since most traffic work usually occurs during the summer months, the first month of fall would be when these new traffic additions were used by the public. So, in our case, the first month of fall would be October and that is how we arrived at our presumed installation date of October 2021.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Sources</h4>
          
          
          <p>In order to create our data story regarding the speed humps on Flatbush Avenue, we utilized many online sources and tools. First, we used <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark.io</a> to help us create the corridor that will determine which points/crashes to include in our data and eventually in our chart. Then, to collect data for our charts we used the <a href="https://www.ctcrash.uconn.edu/">UCONN Crash Data Repository</a> to find all crash data in Hartford for 1 year before and after the speed humps were installed as well as for 17 months before and after the speed humps were installed. Finally, we are using <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">Map Shaper</a> to import our corridor and our crash data all in one place so that we can visualize it. The last sources are our shared google sheet that contains data of the crashes that we obtained from the UCONN Crash Data Repository. There are two sheets: the first contains data and a data analysis of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CAZsiQxcY_k2UnVm7RrxEdAMUgtqGiFCaQgEeNZstfc/edit#gid=1194868756">12 months pre and 12 months post installation</a> and the second contains data and a data analysis of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19NPqJueoC80-kjY_WSZ0AMg8xrD6rI305MHLkV0doUY/edit#gid=980203977">17 months pre and 17 months post installation</a>.
            
            
            
           <h4>Methods</h4>
            
          
          <p>To begin, we first needed to make a corridor around Flatbush Avenue to determine a radius that we can place and count the crash data in (see figure 4). To accomplish this, we used PlaceMark.io and created a line from the Walmart Supercenter on Flatbush Avenue to the intersection of Flatbush Avenue with Zion Street. We then buffered it and made the radius wider to create our corridor. After this, we compiled data of all crashes in Hartford using the UCONN Crash Data Repository from June 2020 (17 months prior to the speed hump installation) to March 2023 (17 months after the speed hump installation). We created two sets of data: one for the 12 months pre and post October 2021 installation and another for the 17 months pre and post October 2021 installation in order to separate the data for our visualizations. After that, we used the Map Shaper platform to join the corridor with the points of data from the UCONN Repository. After that we counted the points that fell in the Flatbush corridor for each set of data (counted the crashes for the 12 months pre, 12 months post, 17 months pre and 17 months post). Finally, our last step was to find the percent change in crashes. So we found percent change from the 12 months pre installation to 12 months post installation and then we found percent change again from the 17 months pre installation to 17 months post installation.</p>
